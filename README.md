SNAP – Speech Navigation and Autonomous Pathfinding. Language Model for Human Machine Interface on an AV 

Below are the high-level goals to build the pipeline:

- [ ] Receive audio input (speech).
- [ ] Convert it to text.
- [ ] Interpret the user’s text command to figure out:
  - [ ] The type of task (e.g. “drive”)
  - [ ] Which destinations (out of possible n total) should be activated (e.g. 10001011 for n = 8).
